What is IRT?
======

IRT is an Integrative Ranking and Thresholding framework for fusion learning in multiple testing. IRT operates under the setting where from each study a 
triplet is available: the vector of binary accept-reject decisions on the tested hypotheses, the study-specific False Discovery Rate (FDR) level and the 
hypotheses tested by the study. Under this setting, IRT constructs an aggregated, nonparametric, and discriminatory measure of evidence against each null hypotheses, 
which facilitates ranking the hypotheses in the order of their likelihood of being rejected. IRT guarantees an overall FDR control under arbitrary dependence between 
the evidence measures as long as the studies control their respective FDR at the desired levels. Furthermore, IRT synthesizes inferences from diverse studies irrespective 
of the underlying multiple testing algorithms employed by them.
